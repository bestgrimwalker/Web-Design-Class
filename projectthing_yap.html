    <img class="w3-round w3-grayscale-min" src="images/WAAAAAAAAGH.jpg" style="width:100%;margin:32px 0">
    <p><i>	Suguru Geto is a great character and probably one of my top favourites. I mostly hated him at first 
      until I saw his early era when he was a teen. Which obviously after seeing Hidden Inventory, I would go 
      ahead and like him. Even after he basically snapped and became a murderer? Eh. It took me a while to 
      really get into liking him. I disliked his intentions and of course the fact that he left his (more than)
      best friend. After rewatching over and over, seeing too many long analysis videos, and easing myself after 
      finishing the traumatising manga that changed everything, I finally came to my senses. What Geto did was 
      valid. His thoughts were to get rid of everyone that lived without jujutsu. All he wanted was to live in a 
      curse-free world to not have to protect the weak humans. These weak humans -- or “monkeys” -- are the cause 
      of cursed spirits according to Geto himself. Therefore, getting rid of non-jujutsu sorcerers will also get 
      rid of cursed spirits to finally live without protecting the weak.
    </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>  Watching humanity crumble from not protecting themselves and then having someone important to you complain 
      about protecting the weak can most likely give someone ideas to act upon that. Geto’s intentions could also 
      come from just wanting to help his best friend, Gojo, and not wanting to see him be used as a weapon. Once 
      Satoru Gojo became the strongest, he was just used as a pure weapon, and not even seen as a human most of the 
      time. Seeing your best friend being used like this probably hurts, so wouldn’t you want to act upon that? Sure, 
      going on a massacre is far, but this is a world of jujutsu. Having the advantage of an ability should be used 
      since basically the rest of the world has nothing like it. He’s basically using his technique to protect the 
      world by sacrificing it all at the same time.
    </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>  Absorbing curses is an amazing technique and probably one of the best, at least in my opinion. Though 
      there are obviously the drawbacks of having to taste the curse. Most likely, the taste of the curse isn’t 
      the only thing that prevents this technique from being too overpowered. Geto is literally swallowing a curse. 
      Curses are made from negative emotions. Put this together in your head. He’s going to feel the effects of 
      negative emotions. Sure, this doesn’t prove anything really. Though, if I had to suffer this all because 
      humans are just unknowingly making my life worse, I’d act upon that too.
    </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>  Sure sure, he didn’t have to go THAT far. But, is there really a better way to do what he did? Maybe, 
      scratch the cult part and just go ahead and not make people suffer and just end them all quickly. Although, 
      what else could he do as a depressed, burnt out, heartbroken, easily influenced, teen? He wanted to go for 
      the better goal with the purpose of either existing to protect the weak or completely get rid of the weak to 
      no longer worry about it. Again, the weak create those curses according to Geto, and so there would be no 
      end to the loop of protecting humans. Blame Yuki for this. She made this sad teen into a villain. Also Toji… 
      He killed Riko in front of Geto and had to carry the burden of not being able to protect her. Riko just made 
      the decision to live just for Toji to cut that short for the money. Don’t go gambling guys… Unless you lost 
      your wife and your whole family hates you. Might as well be a Toji apologist as well.
    </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>  If I was in Suguru Geto’s situation, hell yeah I’d do the same. God forbid a man wants to stop protecting 
      stupid people. Just repopulate with the right people. Don’t risk being stuck in that endless loop. Kill curses, 
      protect humans, humans create those curses, repeat. There’s no way you could just tell everyone; “Hey! Stop 
      thinking negatively and control yourself! Thanks!!” He literally has the power to stop it, so of course he 
      would use that opportunity. Yes, people do not know that they are creating these curses and can’t even see 
      them until they’re in danger, so it just looks like he’s killing them for gits and shiggles. But that’s fine! 
      People won’t do crap if they get randomly told that they’re creating invisible monsters that supposedly create 
      disaster and genocide. I understand that these are innocent people but just sacrifice them for a better life 
      where the strong don’t have to worry about protecting the weak. They could have normal lives and don’t have to 
      stay under cover as well.
    </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>  Also, Geto is just a silly little dude! Just pay attention to him in Hidden Inventory and the way he 
      acts. Forgive this guy! He’s just an innocent silly boy on the inside who just happened to get traumatized, 
      but just not enough to be a main character. Gone too soon. Just imagine his potential. Not as much potential 
      as THE potential man… but just think about it, trust me. Geto was just influenced and depressed, just forgive 
      the poor guy.
    </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>  So basically, Suguru Geto is not that bad of a person. The real bad one is Kenjaku, come on now. When 
      he flipped his whole goal and purpose was when he was just a teen in his second year of high school. He had 
      to spend his life as a sorcerer and could only swallow disgusting curses to use his technique. He had to 
      witness humanity failing him and the ones he cared about most. Geto even had the power to stop the conflicts 
      if he really wanted to, and he tried. I miss Geto and I hate Kenjaku for making everything more doomed than 
      it already is. I know I’m just another one of those “monkeys,” but it’s worth the sacrifice. Don’t blame him. 
      He just wanted a pure world.
